# Graphics Programming

A personal journey into computer graphics — building everything from scratch to understand how things truly work under the hood.

This project starts with a simple **ray tracer** written in JavaScript, following the concepts from the book _“Computer Graphics from Scratch”_ by Gabriel Gambetta. The goal is to explore the core principles of rendering, geometry, and light step by step without relying on external graphics libraries.

Currently renders basic spheres with a minimal scene setup. Future work will include lighting, shading, reflections, and more advanced rendering techniques.
